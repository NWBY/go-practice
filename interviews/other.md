### What is the init function?

The "init" function is a special function in Go that is used to initialize global variables or perform any other setup tasks needed by a package before it is used. The init function is called automatically when the package is first initialized. Its execution order within a package is not guaranteed.

Multiple init functions can be defined within a single package and even within a single file. This allows for modular and flexible initialization of package-level resources. Overall, the init function plays a crucial role in ensuring that packages are correctly initialized and ready to use when they are called.
