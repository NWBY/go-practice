### What is the init function?

The "init" function is a special function in Go that is used to initialize global variables or perform any other setup tasks needed by a package before it is used. The init function is called automatically when the package is first initialized. Its execution order within a package is not guaranteed.

Multiple init functions can be defined within a single package and even within a single file. This allows for modular and flexible initialization of package-level resources. Overall, the init function plays a crucial role in ensuring that packages are correctly initialized and ready to use when they are called.

```go
func init() {
  fmt.Println("This will get called on main initialization")
}

func main() {
  fmt.Println("My Wonderful Go Program")
}
```

Notice in this above example, weâ€™ve not explicitly called the init() function anywhere within our program. Go handles the execution for us implicitly and thus the above program should provide output that looks like this:
```go
$ go run test.go
This will get called on main initialization
My Wonderful Go Program
Awesome, so with this working, we can start to do cool things such as variable initialization.
```

As we can see the init function get automatically called and only gets called once
